☀️ Solar Lead Call Manager – Backend
This is the backend of the Solar Lead Call Manager. It handles all logic and storage behind the scenes to power the frontend React app. This server provides API endpoints for adding, updating, and retrieving solar lead data. It uses environment-specific JSON files (e.g., `data/dev/leads.json`) for local storage and is designed to be easily upgraded to a real database in the future.

🛠️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file **one level above the `server` directory** (or configure your deployment environment) with the following variables before starting the server. The file must define `ADMIN_USERNAME` and either `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (SHA-256) or `ADMIN_PASSWORD`:

```
TWILIO_SID=<your Twilio account SID>
TWILIO_AUTH=<your Twilio auth token>
TWILIO_PHONE_DEV=<Twilio phone number for development>
TWILIO_PHONE_PROD=<Twilio phone number for production>
SERVER_BASE_URL=<public base URL of this server>
ADMIN_USERNAME=<admin login name>
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=<sha256 hash of admin password>
# or
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin password>
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
TOKEN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
# optional overrides
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
# limit calls during development
OPENAI_DEV_MAX_CALLS=50
```

`RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` controls how many requests per minute each IP may make (default `100`).
`TOKEN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` sets how long (in milliseconds) an auth token may remain idle before expiring (default `1800000`).
Authenticated `/bulk-upload` routes are excluded from rate limiting when a valid `Authorization` header is present.

`SERVER_BASE_URL` is used to construct webhook URLs (e.g., Twilio voice and status callbacks).

### OpenAI setup

1. Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Generate a key under **API Keys** and place it in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. (Optional) Set `OPENAI_MODEL` and `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` to adjust the model and temperature used for completions.
4. (Optional) Use `OPENAI_DEV_MAX_CALLS` to cap the number of requests in development.

As of 2024, `gpt-3.5-turbo` costs roughly **$0.50 per 1M input tokens** and **$1.50 per 1M output tokens** (see [pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for updates). You can monitor your usage and remaining quota at [Usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).

Generate `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` with:

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update('yourpassword').digest('hex'))"
```

All API routes (except `/api/auth/*` and `/api/leads/webhook`) require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header obtained via `POST /api/auth/login`.

🔌 API Endpoints
POST /api/auth/login
Authenticate and receive a bearer token.

Request Body:

```json

🧠 Frontend Integration
This backend connects directly with the frontend React app. All fetch requests in the UI are handled by the routes defined here.

Used In:
App.jsx – Retrieves all leads from /api/leads

LeadForm.jsx – Submits new leads via POST /api/leads

LeadCard.jsx – Updates answers, status, and notes via PUT /api/leads/:id

Reports Modal – Pulls and displays JSON data for summaries

📦 Data Model
Stored inside data/leads.json as an array of objects.

📞 Twilio Setup
1. **Upgrade your account**
   - Trial accounts can only call verified numbers and play a trial notice.
   - Upgrade in the Twilio Console to remove these restrictions.
2. **Purchase a phone number**
   - In the Twilio Console, go to *Phone Numbers → Buy* and select a voice-capable number.
   - Use a separate number for development and production if needed.
3. **Collect credentials & set environment variables**
   - In the Twilio Console dashboard, copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.
   - Set them as `TWILIO_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH` in your `.env` file.
   - Assign your phone number to `TWILIO_PHONE_DEV` or `TWILIO_PHONE_PROD` depending on the environment.
   - `SERVER_BASE_URL` should be the public URL of this server for Twilio webhooks.
4. **Configure webhooks**
   - Voice URL: `${SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/phone/voice`
   - Status callback URL: `${SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/phone/status-callback`
   - Set these under your Twilio phone number's **Voice & Fax** settings.
